## Questions
1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today :
 The Internet had its roots during the 1960's as a project of the United States Government’s Department of Defense, to create a non-centralized network. This project was called ARPANET.
 In order to make the network more global a new sophisticated and standard protocol was needed. They developed IP (Internet Protocol) technology which defined how electronic messages were packaged, addressed, and sent over the network. The standard protocol was invented in 1977 and was called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). TCP/IP allowed users to link various branches of other complex networks directly to the ARPANET, which soon came to be called the Internet.

 Researchers and academics in other fields began to make use of the network, and eventually the National Science Foundation (NSF), which had created a similar and parallel network, called NSFNet, took over much of the TCP/IP technology from ARPANET and established a distributed network of networks capable of handling far greater traffic.

In 1985, NSF began a program to establish Internet access across the United States. They created a backbone called the NSFNET and opened their doors to all educational facilities, academic researchers, government agencies, and international research organizations.

By the 1990's the Internet experienced explosive growth. It is estimated that the number of computers connected to the Internet was doubling every year.

The result is that bandwidth (i.e., the information carrying capacity of communications lines) on the Internet has increased tremendously and costs have dropped. It is widely believed that the Internet has played a significant role in the economic success.

2. Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers:
A domain name, is like the address of your home; web hosting on the other hand, is the space of your house where you place your furniture. Instead of street name and area code, set of words or/and numbers are used for the website's naming.

To build a website you will need both a domainname and web hosting account. Buying a domain name alone only gives you right to use that particular domain name for a specific period (usually 1 year). You need web hosting to store your website's files.

 DNS means "Domain Name System". Basically it's the system that translates an domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address (173.194.40.174) which is the unique identifier of some piece of hardware on a network. The need arises for DNS because it's much easier to remember the name than the address. Moreover, a name can translate to several address depending on the time, the load of the server etc.

 A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well.

 A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. The most popular web browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge

3. Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today :
 

* We multitask more. Multitasking existed long before the Internet, of course, but the ubiquity of smartphones — and tabs! infinite tabs!

 * Political campaigns are won (and lost) online.

 * We no longer send telegrams. (Don’t even mention cards and letters).

 * We are our own doctors. 72 percent of Internet users, goes online for health information.

 * No one needs phone books.

 * We’re more socially connected than we were pre-Internet.

* Watches serve no functional purpose. People can easily check the time on a phone or computer.

* We sleep less.

* We work less.

* We socialize, party and relax less.The impact of one minute of Internet leisure on other common activities. Leisure and work time, at left, are most impacted.

* We watch TV shows and movies whenever we want. Gone are the days of VCRs and blank video cassettes!

* Decline in sales of print newspapers since the mid-90s. Print ad sales, meanwhile, have cratered.

* Many languages have died out — or are in the process of doing so. Only 5 percent of the world’s 7,700+ languages have migrated to the Internet, leading some scholars to believe they’ll fade out entirely within the next 100 years.

* We cook from computers. Sales of cookbooks still do well, but millions of people use sites like AllRecipes and Food.com to decide what to eat

* We don’t wait in line at banks. In those now-distant pre-Internet days, people had to physically go into a bank, or at least call it, to check their balance or deposit a check. Online banking has long since eliminated the former task.

* Online Shopping - Seventy-nine percent of teenage women, and 76 percent of teenage men, say they shop online.

* We don’t use encyclopedias or other reference works. If you Google “Encyclopedia Brittanica,” the Wikipedia page for the feted, centuries-old series is one of the first results. That’s part of the reason it went out of print in 2011.

* Privacy might be dead, too. And don’t even try to stay anonymous online.

* We’re closer to each other than we were before. Despite the backlash against social media’s purported superficiality, and the frequent insistence that “ambient ties” don’t tie us much at all, 67 percent of Internet users say they’re closer to friends and family because they talk online.
